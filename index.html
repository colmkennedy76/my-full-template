						<p>Originating in Coventry in the West Midlands of England and with roots stretching back to post-World War 2, the British ska revival
							first emerged in the late 1970s with the formation of The Specials.
						</p>
						<p>The original line up of the band included Jerry Dammers, founder of the influential 2 Tone record label, its black and white motif 
							representing the aspiration towards racial harmony in the context of Thatcher's Britain.
						</p>
						<p>The first release of the fledgeling label - also The Specials' first single - Gangsters, reached number six in the UK music charts 
							paving the way for the emergence of revival ska as a significant genre on the British music scene.
						</p>
						<p>Other British ska revival bands achieving recognition and chart success during the following years included The Selecter, The Beat, 
							Madness and Bad Manners.
						</p>
						<p>Please take a look around the site where you can read all about the history and bands behind the movement and if you'd like to be 
							kept informed about upcoming events you can sign up for our newsletter.
