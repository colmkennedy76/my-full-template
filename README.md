## The 2 Tone Story

### Description

The 2 Tone Story is a website project designed to provide an informative and entertaining resource detailing the origins and development of the British ska and 2 Tone movement of the late 1970s/early 1980s.
The impetus for the project came from the author's keen interest in the subject matter and the fact that a comparable resource could not be found online.
There are many websites which make references to the 2 Tone movement, such as Wikipedia, BBC, Britannica and The Guardian but no single, comprehensive resource seems to be available.


## PROJECT SCOPE

### What's included

As this is an informational website, it was decided that a split display was a good idea in order to present different aspects of the project on the same screen.
On the 'history' page, the screen is split between a historical section and a separate, scrolling section to display relevant images. On the 'bands' page 
the screen is split between a biographical section and a separate, scrolling page navigation section.

### What's not included

It would have been desirable to use collapsible sections in order to allow for more convenient navigation of the 'bands' page when rendered on smaller, portable devices.
Unfortunately, no viable way to achieve this without the use of JavaScript could be found and it was thus considered beyond the scope of this project.

On the 'bands' page, it is possible to play any or all of the videos concurrently. This is very obviously not a desirable scenario but again, the solution to the problem seemed to lie in the use of JavaScript and was therefore considered beyond the scope of this project.
