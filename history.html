					<h4>HMT Windrush</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>'In Jamaica they couldn't find work. Discouraged but full of hope, they sailed for Britain. Citizens of the British Empire coming to the mother country with good intent.'
					The words of a BBC reporter greeting the arrival of HMT Windrush on 21 June 1948. The ship carried 492 Caribbean migrants, many of them veterans of the Second World War. 
					The ship and its passengers have a symbolic status as the start of the Windrush Generation.
					</p>

					<p>That year, the British Nationality Act had been passed granting the status of British Subject to citizens of the UK and Colonies. The act stated that the expression 
					'British Subject' and 'Commonwealth Citizen' would have the same meaning.
					</p>

					<p>These Immigrants brought with them a rich cultural heritage, introducing their traditions, food, music, and style - infusing British culture with vibrant Caribbean 
					influences.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Jamaican Ska</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>After the Second World War, Jamaicans purchased radios in increasing numbers and were able to hear rhythm and blues music from the Southern United States in cities such as New 
					Orleans by artists such as Fats Domino, Barbie Gaye, Rosco Gordon and Louis Jordan whose early recordings all contain the seeds of the "behind-the-beat" feel of ska and 
					reggae. The stationing of American military forces during and after the war meant that Jamaicans could listen to military broadcasts of American music, and there was a 
					constant influx of records from the United States. To meet the demand for that music, entrepreneurs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Buster" target="_blank" 
					rel="noopener" aria-label="link to Prince Buster's wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Prince Buster</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsone_Dodd" 
					target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="link to Coxsone Dodd's wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Coxsone Dodd</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Reid" 
					target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="link to Duke Reid's wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Duke Reid</a> formed sound systems.
					</p>
					<p>As the supply of previously unheard tunes in the jump blues and more traditional R&B genres began to dry up in the late 1950s, Jamaican producers began recording their 
					own version of the genres with local artists. These recordings were initially made to be played on "soft wax" (a lacquer on metal disc acetate later to become known as a 
					"dub plate"), but as demand for them grew eventually sometime in the second half of 1959 (believed by most to be in the last quarter) producers such as Coxsone Dodd and 
					Duke Reid began to issue these recording on 45rpm 7-inch discs. At this point, the style was a direct copy of the American "shuffle blues" style, but within two or three 
					years it had morphed into the more familiar ska style with the off-beat guitar chop that could be heard in some of the more uptempo late-1950s American rhythm and 
					blues recordings such as Domino's "Be My Guest" and Barbie Gaye's "My Boy Lollypop", both of which were popular on Jamaican sound systems of the late 1950s. Domino's 
					rhythm, accentuating the offbeat, was a particular influence.
					</p>
					<p>This "classic" ska style was of bars made up of four triplets but was characterized by a guitar chop on the off beat—known as an upstroke or 'skank'—with horns taking the 
					lead and often following the off-beat skank and piano emphasizing the bass line and, again, playing the skank. Drums kept 4
					4 time and the bass drum was accented on the third beat of each four-triplet phrase. The snare would play side stick and accent the third beat of each 4-triplet phrase. 
					The upstroke sound can also be found in other Caribbean forms of music, such as mento and calypso. Ernest Ranglin asserted that the difference between R&B and ska beats is 
					that the former goes "chink-ka" and the latter goes "ka-chink".
					</p>
					<p>Famous ska band the Skatalites recorded "Dynamite", "Ringo" and "Guns of Navarone". One theory about the origin of ska is that Prince Buster created it during the inaugural
					recording session for his new record label Wild Bells. The session was financed by Duke Reid, who was supposed to get half of the songs to release. The guitar began 
					emphasizing the second and fourth beats in the bar, giving rise to the new sound. The drums were taken from traditional Jamaican drumming and marching styles. To create the 
					ska beat, Prince Buster essentially flipped the R&B shuffle beat, stressing the offbeats with the help of the guitar. Prince Buster has explicitly cited American rhythm and 
					blues as the origin of ska: specifically, Willis Jackson's song "Later for the Gator" (which was Coxsone Dodd's number one selection).
					</p>
					<p>The first ska recordings were created at facilities such as Federal Records, Studio One, and WIRL Records in Kingston, Jamaica with producers such as Dodd, Reid, Prince 
					Buster, and Edward Seaga. The ska sound coincided with the celebratory feelings surrounding Jamaica's independence from the UK in 1962; an event commemorated by songs such 
					as Derrick Morgan's "Forward March" and the Skatalites' "Freedom Sound".
					</p>
					<p>Until Jamaica ratified the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the country did not honor international music copyright protection. This 
					created many cover songs and reinterpretations. One such cover was Millie Small's version of the R&B/shuffle tune, "My Boy Lollypop", first recorded in New York in 1956 by 
					14-year-old Barbie Gaye. Small's rhythmically similar version, released in 1964, was Jamaica's first commercially successful international hit. With over seven million 
					copies sold, it remains one of the best selling reggae/ska songs of all time. Many other Jamaican artists would have success recording instrumental ska versions of popular
					American and British music, such as Beatles songs, Motown and Atlantic soul hits, movie theme songs and instrumentals (007, Guns of Navarone). The Wailers covered the 
					Beatles' "And I Love Her", and radically reinterpreted Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone". They also created their own versions of Latin-influenced music from artists such 
					as Mongo Santamaria. The Skatalites, Lord Creator, Laurel Aitken, Roland Alphonso, Tommy McCook, Jackie Mittoo, Desmond Dekker, and Don Drummond also recorded ska.
					<p>
					<p>Byron Lee & the Dragonaires performed ska with Prince Buster, Eric "Monty" Morris, and Jimmy Cliff at the 1964 New York World's Fair. As music changed in the United States, 
					so did ska. In 1965 and 1966, when American soul music became slower and smoother, ska changed its sound accordingly and evolved into rocksteady. However, rocksteady's heyday 
					was brief, peaking in 1967. By 1968, ska evolved again into reggae.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Ska Revival</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>In the late 1970s, a number of young British bands began reviving the sound of original ska, adding a nervous punk edge to the skittish rhythms. Furthermore, the Ska 
						Revivalists were among the only bands of the era to feature racially integrated lineups, which was a bold political statement for the time. Indeed, ska revival was 
						more implicitly political than any of their British punk and new wave contemporaries.
					</p>
					<p>The leading ska revivalist band was The Specials, who formed their own independent 
						label, 2 Tone. Led by Jerry Dammers and fronted by Terry Hall, the Specials established the sound and approach for all of the bands that followed, and were an immediate 
						hit in England.
					</p>
					<p>Through 2 Tone and a variety of tours, The Specials helped cultivate an active ska revival scene. The group offered support for all of the major ska 
						revivalists that followed, including The Selecter, The Beat, Madness and Bad Manners. Throughout the early 1980s, ska revival bands, particularly Madness, were very popular in 
						the U.K. The groups didn't make much headway in the States until 1982 and 1983, when MTV aired videos by all of the important (and many of the lesser) bands. By that time, 
						most of the bands had run their course and it was just a matter of months before the Specials, Madness, The Beat, and The Selecter all broke up.
					</p>
					<p>Although the ska revival
						bands never became stars outside of the U.K., they did become major cult figures in the U.S. and inspired several generations of musicians to form similar bands. This wave 
						of ska revivalists was equally inspired by hardcore punk and heavy metal, thereby stripping out much of the R&B groove that informed the original ska and 2-Tone artists. 
						Nevertheless, these bands - including Rancid, Mighty Mighty Bosstones and No Doubt - became quite popular in America during the mid-1990s. In the U.K., ska revivalists 
						influenced both Britpop bands like Blur and trip-hop artists like Tricky.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>2 Tone</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>The Specials - originally called The Coventry Automatics - enjoyed a meteoric rise to success following the release of their first single, Gangsters, in 1979. 
						After the success of Gangsters, Chrysalis wanted to sign The Specials directly but Keyboardist and founder member Jerry Dammers instead arranged a deal with Chrysalis to 
						release music under a sub-label called 2 Tone. Dammers intended 2 Tone to be a ska version of the Motown label, the main label that kick started the ska revival of the late 
						1970s/1980s.
					</p>
					<p>The label was a sub-label of Chrysalis Records, but still independent. The era saw a lot of racism, and 2 Tone Records was a bulwark against that, celebrating
						racial unity and combating the rise of the National Front. The whole two-tone scene took off, and the label released early singles that would end up becoming major hits 
						for bands including Madness, the Beat and the Selecter.
					</p>
					<p>The 2 Tone sound originated among young musicians in Coventry in the West Midlands of England, who grew up listening to 1960s Jamaican music. They combined influences from 
						ska, reggae and rocksteady with elements of punk rock and new wave. Bands considered part of the genre include the Specials, the Selecter, Madness, the Beat, Bad Manners, 
						the Bodysnatchers and Akrylykz. The Specials' keyboard player Jerry Dammers coined the term "two-tone". Dammers, with the assistance of Horace Panter and graphic designer 
						John "Teflon" Sims, developed the iconic Walt Jabsco logo (a man in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, pork pie hat, white socks and black loafers) to represent the 
						two-tone genre. The logo, based on an early album-cover photo of Peter Tosh, included an added black-and-white check pattern. Most of the bands considered to be part of the 
						two-tone genre were signed to 2 Tone Records (operative 1979-1985) at some point. Other record labels associated with the 2 Tone sound were Stiff Records and Go Feet 
						Records. The music was especially popular among skinheads, rudies and mod revivalists.
