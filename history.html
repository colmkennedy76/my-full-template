			<p>Two-tone or 2 tone, also known as ska-rock and ska revival, is a genre of British popular music of the late 1970s 
				and early 1980s	that fused traditional Jamaican ska, rocksteady, and reggae music with elements of punk rock and new wave music. Its name derives 
				from 2 Tone Records, a record label founded in 1979 by Jerry Dammers of the Specials, and references a desire to transcend and defuse 
				racial tensions in Thatcher-era Britain: many two-tone groups, such as the Specials, the Selecter and the Beat, featured a mix of black, 
				white, and multiracial people.
			</p>
			<p>Originating in Coventry in the West Midlands of England in the late 1970s, it was part of the second wave of ska music. It followed on from the 
				first ska music that developed in Jamaica in the 1950s and 1960s, infused with punk and new wave textures.
			</p>
			<p>Although two-tone's mainstream commercial appeal was largely limited to the UK, it influenced the ska punk movement that developed in the 
				US in the late 1980s and 1990s.
			</p>
			<p>The two-tone sound originated among young musicians in Coventry in the West Midlands of England, who grew up listening to 1960s Jamaican music. 
				They combined influences from ska, reggae and rocksteady with elements of punk rock and new wave. Bands considered part of the genre include 
				the Specials, the Selecter, Madness, the Beat, Bad Manners, the Bodysnatchers and Akrylykz.

				The Specials' keyboard player Jerry Dammers coined the term "two-tone". Dammers, with the assistance of Horace Panter and graphic designer 
				John "Teflon" Sims, developed the iconic Walt Jabsco logo (a man in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, pork pie hat, white socks and black loafers) 
				to represent the two-tone genre. The logo, based on an early album-cover photo of Peter Tosh, included an added black-and-white check pattern.
				
				Most of the bands considered to be part of the two-tone genre were signed to 2 Tone Records (operative 1979-1985) at some point. Other record labels 
				associated with the two-tone sound were Stiff Records and Go Feet Records. The music was especially popular among skinheads, rudies and mod revivalists.
			</p>
			<p>Jerry Dammers of the ska revival band the Specials started the record label in 1979. Chrysalis had wanted to sign the Specials, but Dammers 
				arranged a label deal, for Chrysalis to fund 15 singles a year and release at least ten of those.

				The label spawned the 2 Tone music and cultural movement, which was popular among skinheads, rudies and some mod revivalists. The label stopped 
				operating in 1986, though "2 Tone" is still used as an imprint for back catalogue issues. 2 Tone Records signed the Selecter, Madness and The Beat, 
				but they all left within two years. 2 Tone Records acts signed a contract that allowed them to leave the label after releasing just one single, which 
				was unusual in the record industry. Madness and The Beat both took advantage of this clause; the former to sign to Stiff Records, and the latter to 
				start their own label, Go Feet Records.
			</p>
			<p>			
				Although 2 Tone Records was closely identified with the ska revival, efforts were made to broaden the label's musical output, releasing recordings by 
				artists such as singer-songwriter Elvis Costello and the funk-punk band the Higsons.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Dammers, with the assistance of Horace Panter and graphic designers John "Teflon" Sims and David Storey, created artwork that was to become central to 
				2 Tone Records. The logo portrays a man in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, pork pie hat, white socks and black loafers. Named "Walt Jabsco", 
				the fictional character was based on a photograph of Peter Tosh, a former member of the Wailers. Walt got his name from an old American bowling shirt 
				that Dammers owned.
