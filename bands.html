					</div>
					<br>
					<p>The Specials were an English ska revival and 2 Tone band formed in 1977 in Coventry. The original lineup of the group consisted of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Hall_(singer)" 
						target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Terry Hall's wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Terry Hall</a> and Neville Staple on vocals, 
						Jerry Dammers</a> 
						on keyboards, Lynval Golding and Roddy Radiation on guitars, Horace Panter on bass, John Bradbury on drums, and Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez on horns. 
						The band wore mod-style 1960s period rude boy outfits (pork pie hats, tonic and mohair suits and loafers). Their music combines the danceable rhythms of ska and 
						rocksteady with the energy and attitude of punk. Lyrically, their work - often written by primary songwriter Dammers - presented overt political and social commentary.
					</p>
					<p>The band's most successful releases were their 1980 The Special AKA Live! EP, featuring lead track "Too Much Too Young", which reached No. 1 on the UK Singles 
						Chart and their 1981 recession-themed single "Ghost Town" which also occupied the No. 1 spot in the UK.
					</p>
					<br>

					<h4 id="specials-history">History</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>The group was formed in 1977 by songwriter/keyboardist Dammers, vocalist Tim Strickland, guitarist/vocalist Lynval Golding, drummer Silverton Hutchinson and bassist 
						Horace Panter ("Sir Horace Gentleman"). Strickland was replaced by Terry Hall shortly after the band's formation. The band was first called the Automatics, then 
						the Coventry Automatics. Guitarist Roddy Byers ("Roddy Radiation") agreed to join the band in March 1978 ahead of a recording session of demos.
					</p>	
					<p>After another band called the Automatics signed a record deal with Island Records the new line-up changed their name to The Special A.K.A. The Automatics . The new 
						name was eventually shortened to The Special AKA which was soon shortened to The Specials - the moniker that would be used for most of the band's career.
					</p>	
					<p>Joe Strummer of The Clash had attended one of their concerts, and invited the Special AKA to open for his band in their "On Parole" UK tour. This performance gave the 
						Special AKA a new level of national exposure, and they briefly shared the Clash's management. During the tour Neville Staple, who was initially one of the roadies, became 
						a full member of The Specials when his version of Monkey Man by Toots and the Maytals was incorporated into the group's set.
					</p>
					<p>In 1979, Dammers formed the 2 Tone Records label and released the band's debut single "Gangsters", a reworking of Prince Buster's "Al Capone". "The Selecter" by 
						The Selecter appeared on the B-side. The fledgling 2 Tone records released Gangsters / The Selecter in a completely independent do-it-yourself operation. After 
						initial good sales, Rough Trade then agreed to repress and distribute the single through its independent distribution network. In May 1979 John Peel played 
						the record on his influential late night BBC Radio One show. The record became a Top 10 hit that summer.
					</p>
					<p>Following the release and early success of "Gangsters", major record labels lined up with offers to sign the Specials. The aim of the Specials was not only to 
						secure a record deal for the group but to get an agreement that would establish 2 Tone as an independent sub-label. The plan was for 2 Tone to put out singles 
						by non-signed bands who would not be held to any contract. Chrysalis agreed to the terms that would establish 2 Tone as a viable independent label and the 
						Specials would get the backing of a major record company.
					</p>
					<p>The band had begun wearing mod/rude boy/skinhead-style two-tone tonic suits, along with other elements of late 1960s teen fashions. Changing their name to the 
						Specials, they recorded their eponymous debut album in 1979, produced by Elvis Costello. Horn players Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez were featured on the album, 
						but would not be official members of the Specials until their second album.
					</p>
					<p>The band's second album, More Specials, was not as commercially successful and was recorded at a time when, according to Hall, conflicts had developed in the 
						band. Backing vocalists on the first two studio albums included Chrissie Hynde, Rhoda Dakar (then of the Bodysnatchers and later of the Special AKA), and 
						Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go's. In the first few months of 1981, the band took a break from recording and touring, and then 
						released "Ghost Town", a non-album single, which reached No. 1 in 1981.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="specials-legacy">Break-up and Reformations</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>At their Top of the Pops recording of Ghost Town, Staple, Hall and Golding announced they were leaving the band. Golding later said: "We didn't talk to the 
						rest of the guys. We couldn't even stay in the same dressing room. We couldn't even look at each other. We stopped communicating. You only realise what a genius 
						Jerry was years later. At the time, we were on a different planet." Shortly afterwards, the three left the band to form Fun Boy Three.
					</p>
					<p>For the next few years, the group was in a constant state of flux. Adding Dakar to the permanent line-up, the group recorded "The Boiler" with Dakar on vocals, 
						Dammers on keyboards, Bradbury on drums, John Shipley (from the Swinging Cats) on guitar, Cuthell on brass and Nicky Summers on bass. The single was credited to 
						"Rhoda with the Special AKA". The track describes an incident of date rape, and its frank and harrowing depiction of the matter meant that airplay was severely limited.
						Nevertheless, it managed to reach No. 35 on the UK charts, and American writer Dave Marsh later identified "The Boiler" as one of the 1,001 best "rock and soul" singles 
						of all time in his book The Heart of Rock & Soul.
					</p>
					<p>After going on tour with Rodriguez, the band (without Dakar, and as "Rico and the Special AKA") also recorded the non-charting (and non-album) single "Jungle Music". 
						The line-up for the single was Rodriguez (vocal, trombone), Cuthell (cornets), Dammers (keyboards), Bradbury (drums), Shipley (guitar), returning bassist Panter, 
						and new additions Satch Dickson and Groco (percussion) and Anthony Wymshurst (guitar).
					</p>
					<p>Rodriguez and the three newcomers were all dropped for the next single, "War Crimes", which brought back Dakar and added new co-vocalists Egidio Newton and Stan Campbell, 
						as well as violinist Nick Parker. Follow-up single "Racist Friend" was a minor hit (UK No. 60), with the band establishing themselves as a septet: Dakar, Newton, Campbell,
						Bradbury, Cuthell, Dammers and Shipley.
					</p>
					<p>The new line-up (still known as the Special AKA) finally issued a new full-length album In the Studio in 1984. Officially, the band was now a sextet: Dakar, Campbell, 
						Bradbury, Dammers, Shipley and new bassist Gary McManus. Cuthell, Newton, Panter and Radiation all appeared on the album as guests; as did saxophonist Nigel Reeve, and 
						Claudia Fontaine and Caron Wheeler of the vocal trio Afrodiziak. Both critically and commercially, In The Studio was less successful than previous efforts, although the 
						1984 single "Free Nelson Mandela" was a No. 9 UK hit. The latter contributed to making Mandela's imprisonment a cause celebre in the UK, and became popular with 
						anti-apartheid activists in South Africa. Dammers then dissolved the band and pursued political activism.

					</div>
					<br>

					<p>The Selecter is an English 2 tone ska revival band, formed in Coventry, England, in 1979. The band featured a diverse line-up, both in terms of race and gender, 
						initially consisting of Arthur 'Gaps' Hendrickson and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Black" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Pauline Black's 
						wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Pauline Black</a> on lead vocals, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neol_Davies" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Neol Davies' 
						wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Neol Davies</a> and Compton Amanor on guitar, Desmond Brown on Hammond organ, 
						Charley 'Aitch' Bembridge on drums, and Charley Anderson on bass. The band's name comes from the original "The Selecter" track, which appeared on the flip side 
						of The Special AKA's "Gangsters" single in 1979, and was written by Neol Davies and John Bradbury, produced by Roger Lomas and featured Barry Jones on trombone.
					</p>
					<p>The band were one of the most successful ska bands of the 2 tone era, notching up several top forty singles in the UK Singles Chart. Having co-released the first 
						2 tone ska single with the Specials, they were one of the founding acts of the movement. Though influential, the original lineup only remained together for a year, 
						and even with replacement players the band continued until breaking up in 1982.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="selecter-history">History</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>In 1977, Neol Davies and John Bradbury (who later became a member of the Specials), with the trombone player Barry Jones, recorded a track in a recording session 
						in 1977–78 that resulted in "Kingston Affair", which was produced by Coventry producer Roger Lomas. It was initially credited to 'The Selecters' and although 
						the record was touted around the industry, there were no takers and it remained on the shelf until 1979, when it was released as "The Selecter" as a double a-side 
						with the Special AKA's recording "Gangsters", the first 2 Tone Records single. It was released in March 1979, reaching 6 in the UK Singles Chart. The track was 
						written by Davies and Bradbury.
					</p>
					<p>After the success of the single, Davies put a band together to capitalise on the resulting publicity. He had recently been playing in Transposed Men with keyboard 
						player Desmond Brown and Brown joined the band, along with bass player Charley Anderson, guitarist Compton Amanor, drummer Aitch Bembridge and vocalist Gaps Hendrickson. 
						All the musicians had played on the local scene in Coventry for a number of years with bands such as The Ray King Soul Band, Hard Top 22 and others. The seven piece 
						line-up for the original band was completed when Pauline Black was spotted by Davies. Davies offered Pauline an audition with the Selecter – she joined along with other 
						members in July 1979.
					</p>
					<p>The new band released the singles "On My Radio", "Three Minute Hero" and "Missing Words", written by Davies. The Selecter's debut studio album, Too Much Pressure, was 
						recorded at the end of 1979 and was released in February 1980 by 2 Tone Records and Chrysalis Records. Anderson and Brown left the Selecter in 1980 to form the People. 
						Their replacements were James Mackie and Adam Williams. Their second studio album, Celebrate the Bullet was released in February 1981 and the title track has a music 
						video that aired on MTV's first day of broadcast, before Black left the band to pursue a solo career. A short time after, unsuccessfully having tried Stan Campbell as 
						the singer, the rest of the members disbanded. The Selecter were featured in the 2 Tone film documentary and on the live compilation album Dance Craze (1981).
						
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="selecter-legacy">Break-up and Reformations</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>After the band split in 1982, Black pursued a career in theatre, television and film. From 1991 she led a reformed Selecter for 15 years releasing several new albums. 
						In 2006 she took a sabbatical from the Selecter, to write her memoirs Black by Design for publishing house Serpent's Tail. In 2009, she returned to the live arena, 
						playing shows in the UK, Germany and South America guesting with various ska musicians and performing songs from the Selecter's first two studio albums. During her 
						sabbatical, Black recorded a new 13-track solo album, Pigment of My Imagination, released in 2011. She later reformed the Selecter, this time with guest original lead 
						singer Arthur "Gaps" Hendrickson, and in 2010 they played two shows at the Sinner's Day Festival at the Ethias Arena in Hasselt, Belgium, and at the Bloomsbury Ballroom 
						in London.
					</p>
					<p>Neol Davies penned all of the Selecter's hit singles. He started up his own home studio after the band disbanded in 1981 to write and record his own new songs, and he 
						played a number of local shows in the Midlands while teaching guitar in local schools. Davies formed a new version of the Selecter in 1991 with Black leaving the band 
						two years later. He started up a new outfit called Selecter Instrumental, mostly playing movie tunes in a ska style. In the early 1990s, he joined a reunited Specials 
						in the studio, contributing rhythm guitar to sessions that would later be released as the cover albums Skinhead Girl (2000) and Conquering Ruler (2001). In 1998, he 
						released his debut solo studio album Box of Blues, assisted by bass player Horace Panter of the Specials and drummer Anthony Harty, and the trio often performed at a 
						number of blues concerts in the UK. He later recorded another solo studio album, Future Swamp (2002), with guests including Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones and Reef 
						members Dominic Greensmith and Jason Knight. Both albums were released on Davies' own label, VoMatic Records.
					</p>
					<p>Charley Anderson moved to Sweden during the 1990s where he performed, recorded and released material with the Skalatones. In 2009, Anderson returned to Coventry to play 
						a charity concert at the Central Hall to promote his Ghetto Child project. Joining him on stage were guests from UB40, the Specials, the Selecter along with saxophonist 
						Carlos Garnett.
					</p>	
					<p>Charley 'Aitch' Bembridge has been involved with the All Skas, a ska band which performed in the Midlands. He also served as drummer in the Specials through their first 
						reunion, both live and in the studio, from 1993 through to 1998. He rejoined Black and Hendrickson's version of the band in 2021.
					</p>	
					<p>Davies, Hendrickson, Anderson and Black were also involved with unveiling commemorative plaques for the 30th anniversary of 2 Tone on significant buildings associated 
						with the record label in Coventry.
					</p>
					<p>Davies and Black reunited towards the end of the 1980s, performing as a duo, with Davies on electric guitar and Black on vocals. The pair featured on an episode of a 
						Jools Holland music show that was broadcast on European satellite television. Then, in 1990, after two guest spots with Bad Manners, and being genuinely surprised by 
						the reception they received, Black and Davies reformed the Selecter with three members of Bad Manners, Martin Stewart, Nick Welsh and Perry Melius, in 1991.
					</p>
					<p>After releasing a new version of "On My Radio", backed up with a new version of "The Selecter" and performing some tours, Davies departed the band in 1993. From 1994 
						to 1996, another original member, Arthur 'Gaps' Hendrickson, performed with this line-up occasionally. They released several new albums, toured around the world and 
						toured with No Doubt in 1997 in the US. 1998's politically-focused Cruel Britannia was critically acclaimed. Black continued to record and perform as the Selecter up 
						until 2006, and from 2010 to the present.
					</p>
					<p>On 31 October 2010, Pauline Black and Arthur 'Gaps' Hendrickson played under the Selecter name to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the seminal debut studio album, 
						Too Much Pressure (1980), by performing the whole album live at the Sinners Day Festival, Ethias Stadium, Hasselt, Belgium. They also performed at the Bloomsbury 
						Ballroom, London, in November 2010. In her capacity as lead singer of the Selecter, Black featured prominently in BBC Four's Reggae Britannia series in February 2011 
						and the televised 'Reggae Britannia Concert' at the Barbican, London, alongside Ken Boothe, Neville Staple and Brinsley Forde of Aswad.
					</p>
					<p>The Selecter reunited once again when the band travelled over to Belfast, Northern Ireland, to play a show in the capital's annual Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival. 
						This was followed by an extensive tour of the UK, Europe, and in October 2014, New Zealand and Australia.
					</p>
					<p>In 2022, the Selecter toured the UK performing their second studio album Celebrate the Bullet (1981) in its entirety.

						<br>
					</div>
				
					<p>The Beat - known in the United States and Canada as the English Beat and in Australia as the British Beat - are a English band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1978. 
						Their music fuses Latin, ska, pop, soul, reggae and punk rock. The original band, consisting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Wakeling" target="_blank" 
						rel="noopener" aria-label="Dave Wakeling's wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Dave Wakeling</a> (vocals, guitar), Ranking Roger (vocals), Andy Cox (guitar), 
						David Steele (bass), Everett Morton (drums), and Saxa a.k.a. Lionel Augustus Martin (saxophone), released three studio albums in the early 1980s: I Just Can't Stop It 
						(1980), Wha'ppen? (1981) and Special Beat Service (1982), and a string of singles, including "Mirror in the Bathroom", "Save It for Later", "I Confess", "Too Nice to Talk 
						To", "Can't Get Used to Losing You", "Hands Off...She's Mine", and "All Out to Get You".
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="beat-history">History</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>The Beat formed in Birmingham, England, in 1978, during a period of high unemployment and social upheaval in the United Kingdom. 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_Roger" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Ranking Roger wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Ranking Roger</a>, 
						one of the band's vocalists, 
						added a Jamaican vocal flavour to the band's sound with his toasting style. Jamaican saxophonist Saxa added a Jamaican ska instrumental sound. Saxa (born Lionel Augustus 
						Martin in 1930) had played saxophone with Prince Buster, Laurel Aitken, and Desmond Dekker in the first wave of ska. He joined the Beat to record their first single, 
						"Tears of a Clown", a cover version of the Motown hit by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles.
					</p>
					<p>The band's debut studio album, I Just Can't Stop It, was released in May 1980, entering the UK albums chart at No. 3. Notable singles from the album included "Can't Get 
						Used to Losing You", "Mirror in the Bathroom", "Hands Off...She's Mine" and "Best Friend". The second Beat album, Wha'ppen? was supported by extensive touring, including 
						a United States tour with the Pretenders and Talking Heads. The album yielded more UK hits, with "All Out to Get You", "Drowning" and "Doors of Your Heart", all of which 
						broke into the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The Beat received support from modern rock radio stations such as KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, the now-defunct KQAK The Quake 
						99FM in San Francisco and KYYX in Seattle.
					</p>
					<p>Although the Beat's main fan base was in the UK, the band was also popular in Australia, partly due to exposure on the radio station Triple J and the TV show Countdown. 
						The Beat had a sizable following in the US and Canada, where the band were known as the English Beat for legal reasons (to avoid confusion with the American band the Beat). 
						The Beat toured the world with well-known artists including David Bowie, the Clash, the Police, the Pretenders, R.E.M., the Specials and Talking Heads. Members of the band 
						often collaborated on stage with the Specials.
					</p>
					<p>During their early career, the band were associated with Birmingham-based cartoonist Hunt Emerson, who designed their 'Beat Girl' icon and painted the mural that was used 
						on the cover of Wha'ppen?
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="beat-legacy">Break-up and Reformations</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>After the break-up of the Beat in 1983, Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger went on to form General Public and had a couple of hit singles in the US and Canada including 
						"Tenderness", while Andy Cox and David Steele formed Fine Young Cannibals with vocalist Roland Gift from the ska band Akrylykz. Drummer Everett Morton and Saxa formed 
						the International Beat along with the Birmingham-based singer, Tony Beet, and the band released an album titled The Hitting Line on Blue Beat Records in 1990. The album 
						was produced by Ranking Roger and he often guested with the band at some of their shows. The International Beat toured the UK and United States until 1992.
					</p>
					<p>Ranking Roger also briefly joined Mick Jones' post-Clash band Big Audio Dynamite and performed at several live shows with the band. However, the band broke up shortly after 
						he joined when its last album was shelved by the record company. Meanwhile, "March of the Swivelheads", an instrumental version of the Beat's song "Rotating Head", was used 
						in the climactic chase scene of 1986's Ferris Bueller's Day Off; the band was listed in the end credits as "The (English) Beat". "Save It for Later" was featured on the 
						soundtrack album to 1996's Kingpin, 2010's Hot Tub Time Machine and 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming.
					</p>
					<p>Everett Morton formed Beat Goes Bang and recruited vocalist Ross Lydon from 360, bass player Faisal Rashid, and Lukasz Machometa on sax, former member of Citybeats and Urban 
						Groove Syndicate.
					</p>
					<p>Roger released his solo debut, a reggae-oriented album entitled Radical Departure, in 1988. In the early 1990s, Roger joined members of the Specials to form Special Beat, 
						which toured and released two live albums. They supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). In 2001, Roger released another solo album, Inside My Head, which 
						included traditional reggae and ska with influences of electronica, jungle and dub. Ranking Roger's son, Ranking Junior, followed in his father's footsteps. In 2005, he 
						appeared on the Ordinary Boys' single "Boys Will Be Boys".
					</p>
					<p>In 2003, the Beat's original line-up, minus Cox and Steele, played a sold-out one-off gig at the Royal Festival Hall. In 2004, the VH1 show Bands Reunited tried unsuccessfully 
						to reunite the original line-up.
					</p>
					<p>In 2006, the UK version of the Beat, featuring Ranking Roger, recorded a new album that was mixed by Adrian Sherwood, but it remains unreleased. The band also featured 
						Everett Morton and Mickey Billingham on keyboards, formerly a member of Dexys Midnight Runners and General Public.
					</p>
					<p>Dave Wakeling fronts the US version of the group as the English Beat, which usually adds a couple of General Public songs to the setlist. The singer and his band flew over 
						to the UK in April 2011, to perform at the London International Ska Festival at the Clapham Grand music venue. They played the Great Dorset Steam Fair show 2011 on 31 
						August 2011. At this point, both the UK and US versions of the band continued to tour frequently on either sides of the Atlantic.
					</p>
					<p>In mid-2012, the Beat released a box set, titled The Complete Beat, comprising their three albums along with non-album singles, remixes and live material. Additional bonus tracks were included on re-released, double-CD versions of each studio album.

						<br>
					</div>
					<p>Madness are an English ska and pop band from Camden Town, north London, who formed in 1976. One of the most prominent bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s two-tone 
						ska revival, they continue to perform with six of the seven members of their original line-up. Madness's most successful period was from 1980 to 1986, when the band's 
						songs spent a total of 214 weeks on the UK Singles Chart.
					</p>
					<p>Madness have had 16 singles reach the UK top ten, including "One Step Beyond", "Baggy Trousers" and "It Must Be Love", one UK number-one single "House of Fun" and two 
						number ones in Ireland, "House of Fun" and "Wings of a Dove". "Our House" was their biggest US hit, reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2000, the band received 
						the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for Outstanding Song Collection.

					<p>The core of the band formed as the North London Invaders in 1976, and included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Barson" target="_blank" rel="noopener" 
						aria-label="Mike Barson's wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Mike Barson</a> (Monsieur Barso) on keyboards and vocals, Chris Foreman (Chrissy Boy) on guitar 
						and Lee Thompson (Kix) on saxophone and vocals. They later recruited John Hasler on drums and Cathal Smyth (better known as Chas Smash) on bass guitar. Later in the year, 
						they were joined by lead vocalist Dikran Tulaine.
					</p>
					<p>This six-piece line-up lasted until part-way through 1977, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" 
						aria-label="Graham McPherson's wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Graham McPherson</a> ("Suggs") took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's 
						garden. 
						Tulaine went on to be an actor. Smyth, who left after an argument with Barson, was replaced by Gavin Rodgers, Barson's girlfriend's brother. McPherson was kicked out of 
						the band for choosing too often to watch Chelsea instead of rehearsing. Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his saxophone playing.
					</p>
					<p>By 1978, the band had allowed McPherson to return as a vocalist after he had filled in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed). 
						Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Dan Woodgate (Woody) and bassist Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and 
						Rodgers, respectively. After briefly changing their name to Morris and the Minors, the band renamed itself as Madness in 1979, paying homage to one of their favourite songs 
						by ska and reggae artist Prince Buster. The band remained a sextet until late 1979 when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a 
						backing vocalist and dancer.

						During 1979, the band began to attract a live following in London, being regulars at the Dublin Castle in Camden Town. The band's first commercial recording was the 
						Lee Thompson composition "The Prince". The song, like the band's name, paid homage to their idol, Prince Buster. The song was released through 2 Tone Records, the 
						label of the Specials founder and keyboardist Jerry Dammers. The song was a surprise hit, peaking in the UK music charts at number 16. Madness toured with fellow 2 
						Tone bands the Specials and the Selecter, before recording their debut studio album.
					</p>
					<p>That debut studio album, One Step Beyond... was released by Stiff Records. The album included a re-recording of "The Prince" and its B-side "Madness", and the band's 
						second and third singles: "One Step Beyond" and "My Girl". The title song was a cover of the B-side of the 1960s Prince Buster hit "Al Capone". The One Step Beyond... 
						album stayed in the British charts for 78 weeks, peaking at number 2. Smyth performed on the album but was not an official member of the band at the time of the 
						album's recording or release. He would formally join Madness a few weeks after One Step Beyond... was issued in October 1979.
					</p>
					<p>After the release of "My Girl", the band felt that they had exhausted the material from One Step Beyond..., and did not want to release any more singles from the album. 
						However, Dave Robinson, head of Stiff Records, disagreed. Eventually, a compromise was made, and the band decided to release an EP featuring one album track and three 
						new tracks. The result was the Work Rest and Play EP, which was headlined by the song "Night Boat to Cairo", from the One Step Beyond album. The EP reached number 6 in 
						the UK Singles Chart.
					</p>
					<p>In 1980, the band's second studio album, Absolutely reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart. Absolutely spawned some of the band's biggest hits, most notably "Baggy 
						Trousers", which peaked at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. "Embarrassment" reached number 4 in the charts, and the instrumental song "The Return of the Los Palmas 7" 
						climbed to number 7. Although the album reviews were generally less enthusiastic than those of One Step Beyond..., they were mostly positive. Robert Christgau gave the 
						album a favourable B− grade, but Rolling Stone awarded the album just one out of five stars. Rolling Stone was particularly scathing of the ska revival in general, 
						stating that "The Specials wasn't very good" and Madness were simply "the Blues Brothers with English accents".
					</p>
					<p>A drama-documentary film titled Take It or Leave It was released in 1981, featuring the band members playing themselves in a re-creation of their early days to the 
						then-current period. Live recordings of Madness performances as well as those by other 2 Tone bands were used in the 1981 documentary film and soundtrack album Dance 
						Craze.
					</p>
					<p>In 1981, the band's third studio album, 7, reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart and contained three hit singles: "Grey Day" (no. 4, April 1981), "Shut Up" (no. 7, 
						September 1981), and "Cardiac Arrest" (no. 14, February 1982). In an article in 1979, Chris Foreman explained that the band's music would move with the times, and change 
						styles as time goes on. This was shown to be the case, as unlike the two ska-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, 7 was something of a change in direction. Suggs' 
						vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong accent from the previous studio albums had been watered down. The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of One 
						Step Beyond... and Absolutely and moved towards a pop sound; a trend that continued with subsequent studio albums.
					</p>
					<p>Near the end of 1981, Madness released one of their most recognised songs: a cover of Labi Siffre's 1971 hit "It Must Be Love". The song climbed to number 4 in the UK, and 
						in 1983, the song peaked at number 33 in the US charts. In 1982, Madness released their only number 1 hit to date, "House of Fun" and also reached number 1 in the album 
						charts with their first compilation, Complete Madness (1982).
					</p>
					<p>In November 1982, they released their fourth studio album, The Rise & Fall, which was well received in the UK, but did not get an American release. Instead, many of its songs 
						were included on the US compilation Madness (1983), including "Our House", which was their most internationally successful single to date. "Our House" reached number 5 in the 
						UK music charts and number 7 in the US charts; it was also performed on The Young Ones. Many reviewers compared The Rise & Fall to the Kinks' The Village Green Preservation
						Society (1968), and it is at times retrospectively considered a concept album. The album also featured "Primrose Hill", which was more similar to the Beatles song 
						"Strawberry Fields Forever", containing similar psychedelic imagery and a layered arrangement.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="madness-legacy">Break-up and Reformations</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>In 1983, their single "Wings of a Dove" peaked at number 2 in the UK charts, followed by "The Sun and the Rain" (no. 5, November 1983). Their following studio album, 
						Keep Moving, peaked at number 6 in the UK Albums Chart, and two singles from that album reached the top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. The album received some good reviews, 
						with Rolling Stone magazine giving the album four out of five stars, applauding the band's changing sound. This was an improvement as the last album reviewed by the 
						magazine, Absolutely, was heavily criticised.
					</p>
					<p>On 5 October 1983 the band were rehearsing and discussing a possible television series, which was being written for them by Ben Elton and Richard Curtis. Barson then 
						informed the band that he would not be able to take part, as he was tired of the music business and wanted to spend more time with his wife. They had recently relocated 
						to Amsterdam. Barson agreed to finish recording the album Keep Moving; he left after playing for the last time with the band at the Lyceum Ballroom on 21 December 1983. 
						James Mackie took Barson's place appearing with Madness on the US television show Saturday Night Live on 14 April 1984. After leaving the band, Barson returned to the UK 
						for the filming of two music videos as he had played on the tracks, "Michael Caine" and "One Better Day". Barson finished live performance with the band in 1983, and 
						officially left the band in June 1984, following the release of "One Better Day". Paul Carrack took Barson's place whilst the band toured America in early 1984. The six 
						remaining members left Stiff Records and formed their own label, Zarjazz Records, which was a sub-label of Virgin Records.
					</p>
					<p>In 1985, the label released the band's sixth studio album, Mad Not Mad. Barson's usual keyboard parts were filled by an emphasis on synthesisers provided by Steve Nieve 
						of the Attractions. In later years, frontman Suggs has described the album as a "polished turd". The album reached number 16 in the UK charts, which is the band's lowest 
						position on the album charts to date. Despite the poor chart showing, the album was listed as number 55 in NME's "All Time 100 Albums". The singles for the album fared 
						even worse, with "Yesterday's Men" peaking at number 18 in the UK charts. The subsequent singles, "Uncle Sam" and "Sweetest Girl", failed to make the top 20, which was a 
						first for Madness singles.
					</p>	
					<p>The band then attempted to record a new studio album, and 11 demo tracks were recorded. However, musical differences arose between the band members. The untitled album 
						went unreleased, and in September 1986, the band announced that they were to break-up. Barson rejoined the band for a farewell single, "(Waiting For) The Ghost Train", 
						but did not appear in the music video. The band officially broke up following the release of the single, which reached a high of number 18 in the UK. In 1988, four members 
						of the band – Suggs, Chas Smash, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman – continued under the name The Madness. After one self-titled studio album and two singles that failed to 
						make the top 40, the band broke up.

						<p class="video-info text-center">Bad Manners - Special Brew (TOTP 1980)</p>
						<br>
					</div>
					<p>Bad Manners are an English two-tone and ska band led by frontman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Bloodvessel" target="_blank" rel="noopener" 
						aria-label="Buster Bloodvessel's wikipedia page (link opens in a new tab)">Buster Bloodvessel</a>. Early appearances included Top of the Pops and the live 
						film documentary Dance Craze (1981).
					</p>	
					<p>They were at their most popular during the early 1980s, during a period when other ska revival bands such as Madness, the Specials and the Selecter filled the charts. 
						Bad Manners spent 111 weeks in the UK Singles Chart between 1980 and 1983, and they also achieved chart success with their first four studio albums, with Ska 'n' B (1980), 
						Loonee Tunes! (1980), and Gosh It's ... Bad Manners (1981) being their biggest hits.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="bad-manners-history">History</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>Fronted by Buster Bloodvessel (real name Douglas Trendle), the band was formed in 1976,[4] while the members were together at Woodberry Down Comprehensive School, near 
						Manor House, North London. They commemorated the 1981 closure of the school on the back sleeve of their album, Gosh It's ... Bad Manners, released that year.
						
					<p>After becoming popular in their native London, Bad Manners signed a recording contract with Magnet Records in 1980, and became regular guests on television shows such as 
						Tiswas. The band also appeared on The British Music Awards (1981) and Cheggers Plays Pop. In 1985, they also appeared on The Time of Your Life, hosted by Noel Edmonds. 
						Being closely associated with the 2 Tone movement (though never signed to 2 Tone Records itself), they were one of six bands featured in the 1981 documentary film Dance 
						Craze.
					</p>	
					<p>Some of their hit singles through the 1980's include "Nee Nee Na Na Na Na Nu Nu", "My Girl Lollipop", "Lip Up Fatty", "Can Can", "Special Brew", "Walking in the Sunshine" 
						and "That'll Do Nicely".
					</p>	
					<p>One of the main reasons for their notoriety was their outlandish huge-tongued and shaven-headed frontman, Buster Bloodvessel. His manic exploits got them banned from the 
						British BBC TV chart show Top of the Pops, for painting his head red. The band was also banned from Italian TV after Bloodvessel mooned a concert audience on live 
						television at the 1983 Sanremo Music Festival, after being told that the Pope was watching on TV.
					</p>
					<p>Bad Manners had spent 111 weeks in the UK Singles Chart between 1980 and 1983, however, Bad Manners left Magnet Records in 1983, and joined Telstar Records releasing a 
						compilation album, The Height of Bad Manners, which reached number 23 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was assisted with a television advertisement, and it brought the 
						band back to the attention of the media and the British public – but no further chart hits.
					</p>	
					<p>The group then went on to sign a contract with Portrait Records in the United States and Mental Notes was released in 1985. For two years the band toured continuously all 
						over the world but decided to disband in 1987.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4 id="bad-manners-legacy">Break-up and Reformations</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>After Bad Manners disbanded for a brief spell after their deal with Portrait Records ended, Buster Bloodvessel formed a new outfit called Buster's Allstars in 1987, which 
						enabled him and a few of his friends to continue performing in and around London. The capital's venues were often packed to capacity and this prompted the then 20 stone 
						vocalist to reform Bad Manners with his fellow original members Louis Alphonso, Martin Stewart, Winston Bazoomies and Chris Kane. During 1988, the revamped Bad Manners band 
						line-up started to play a number of shows at universities and at scooter rallies and they licensed the name and logo of Blue Beat Records, setting up office inside a 50-foot 
						(15 m) barge called the Blood Vessel in the back garden of Buster Bloodvessel's former home in London. After Blue Beat became defunct in 1990, Bad Manners were without a 
						recording contract, but continued to tour. In 1992, they signed a deal with Pork Pie Records and Fat Sound was released in Europe. The album was originally intended to be 
						released in the UK on Blue Beat.
					</p>	
					<p>In 1996, Buster Bloodvessel moved to Margate and opened a hotel on the seafront called Fatty Towers, which catered for people with huge appetites. While living in Margate, 
						he was a regular spectator at Margate F.C., and Bad Manners sponsored the club for one season. Fatty Towers closed in 1998 and did not re-open despite a facelift. After 
						its closure, Buster Bloodvessel moved back to London.
					</p>	
					<p>After five years without releasing any new material, Bad Manners issued their Heavy Petting album in 1997. Six years later, Buster set up another record label and the 
						band released Stupidity on Bad Records in 2003.
					</p>	
					<p>In 2004, Bad Manners appeared on Never Mind the Buzzcocks in the Christmas Special, performing festive songs to the contestants which included Phill Jupitus and Noddy 
						Holder (Jupitus is a fan of the band, and Buster Bloodvessel had appeared as a panellist on the show earlier that year).
					</p>	
					<p>Buster Bloodvessel is the only original member to remain in Bad Manners, but the harmonica player, Winston Bazoomies, was an 'honorary member' of the band. Bazoomies had 
						a Facebook fanpage set up in his honour and lived in North London.
					</p>	
					<p>Martin Stewart left Bad Manners in 1991, and performed and recorded with the Selecter for fifteen years. He now lives a quiet life in Middlesex with his family, and most 
						recently played the keyboards in a band called the Skatalysts. Louis Alphonso lives in Paris and released his A Noir solo studio album on the French Fries record label in 
						2015, while his fellow musician, David Farren, left in 1987 after the band's contract with Portrait Records ended. Farren designed the original band logo, and painted the 
						front cover of the album Gosh It's ... Bad Manners (1981). He currently performs in a tribute outfit called the Rollin' Stoned. Chris Kane is a session musician. He left 
						his longtime London home in 2015 and moved to Cambridgeshire. He became a music teacher during the 1990s and also performed with the Jordanaires after leaving Bad Manners. 
						He also enjoys visiting Sweden during his spare time but he can still be seen playing his saxophone with numerous outfits. Brian Tuitt also left the band in 1987 and lives 
						in Kent. The drummer has been performing with Ben Russell & the Charmers in recent times while also working with the Barry White Unlimited Love Tour at various venues in the 
						UK, while Andrew Marson, who also left the group the same year, has worked as a carpenter in and around London and also enjoys performing in a country and western outfit 
						called the Drawbacks. Paul Hyman, another original member who left the band in the late 1980s, lives in Enfield and works in the London Stock Exchange, a job he has had 
						since leaving Bad Manners.
					</p>	
					<p>Bad Manners headlined their own annual music festival known as Bad Fest in 2005 and 2006 at RAF Twinwood Farm. This festival featured ska, mod-related and punk rock bands 
						from the 1980s to the present.
					</p>	
					<p>In 2011, Cherry Red Records released the band's first four studio albums, Ska 'n' B (1980), Loonee Tunes! (1980), Gosh It's ... Bad Manners (1981) and Forging Ahead (1982) on 
						CD for the first time with added bonus tracks. The albums were issued on their sister label, Pressure Drop.
					</p>	
					<p>In December 2012, the band released their first single in thirteen years. "What Simon Says" was released via download just before the festive season, and the music video 
						featured Bad Manners fans from across the world but none of the band members themselves. The song hints at the power Simon Cowell has within the UK music industry.
					</p>	
					<p>In December 2012, founding members of the band met for the first time in decades at the Ship public house in Soho, London. Paul Hyman, Martin Stewart, Brian Tuitt and Chris 
						Kane met with band historian and harmonica player David Turner, and Christopher 'Dell' Wardell, a music writer and promoter from Darlington. On 18 July 2013, seven of the 
						original nine members reunited at The Brownswood public house, near Finsbury Park, that is within striking distance of their old school, Woodbery Down Comprehensive. The 
						'Bad Manners Originals' who attended the reunion were Andy Marson (alto sax), Paul Hyman (trumpet), Winston Bazoomies (Alan Sayag) (harmonicas), Chris Kane (tenor sax), 
						David Farren (bass), Martin Stewart (keyboards) and Brian Tuitt (drums). The meetings were arranged after Wardell's 'Where Are They Now?' article was published in The 
						Northern Echo in 2012, providing details on the current whereabouts of all of the original band members.
					</p>
					<p>During 2016, Bad Manners toured the United Kingdom to celebrate their 40th Anniversary.
					</p>
					<p>Original member Winston Bazoomies died on 1 December 2022, at the age of 63.
					</p>	
					<p>The band are still touring the United Kingdom in 2024.
